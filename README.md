ðŸ‘‹  Hi there, Iâ€™m Joshua Silets. Most of my work here is in private repositories so you probably won't be able to see anything unless I am currently working on something public.

Here's a shortlist about what I'm currently doing.

- Bioinformatics Research @ The University of Chicago
- Studying Artificial Intelligence @ Illinois Tech
- Blockchain Consulting and Development @ RAPID Studios

If you'd like to talk about Web3, Bioinformatics, AI or just connect you can contact me below.
